Hospital Management System Project is designed to manage patients, doctors, and appointments using a MySQL database. The system allows users to add patients, view patient records, view a list of doctors, and book appointments. It employs JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a connection with a MySQL database, and the main class orchestrates the interaction with the system through a console-based menu. The Patient and Doctor classes handle operations related to patients and doctors, respectively. The "bookAppointment" method ensures that an appointment is booked only if both the patient and doctor exist and the doctor is available on the specified date. Overall, the program demonstrates basic functionality for maintaining patient and doctor information, scheduling appointments, and provides a simple yet effective tool for hospital management.
